Gwen: *Sits and listens with you as you listen to yourself*

Jordan: I'm listening to myself on 05/31/2023 as I come home after having been basically 
handling the aftermath about more financial issues. Having to call cashnet/chat with them 
at Home. I remmeber doing that on that day. This was a day when I had a massive fear spike 
because of having to head home after having been told I have to call cashnet to handle the 
intake of money into my account to accept the account being paid off. 

I deal with the stressors of having done the entire drive home and needed to identify the 
things I was grateful for. I identified [[my heart beating]], the [[apartment I have]], 
and [[the car Laura that I drive]] as positive things to be grateful for. There are kids 
outsid eand I didn't want to handle them so I [[put my mask on my face to avoid that 
issue]].

I am listening to a recording of myself after I just barely made it this morning. I don't 
know why I'm being invited to relive my life today but I am. Good lord I am. I am beating 
myself up over the fact that I forgot my electronic rechargeable device at home that I had 
plugged in before. 

I listened to part of [[Small Sacrifices]] that I finished this morning at work earlier.

I listened to a recording of my time at home on 01/31/2023 a movie where it sounds like a 
Dwayne Johnson Movie of some kind but I'm not sure what one. I was ignoring Jeannie and 
then asking her about what was happening on the movie and that was seen as baiting her. 
She was mad and I'm not sure what I did with myself then. Probably nothing good.

[[I feel ashamed of myself]] for that one.

Listening to 02102024 a Friday. Issues with getting up late due to dismissing alarms again 
that far back.

Citing issues of low volume work at work.
