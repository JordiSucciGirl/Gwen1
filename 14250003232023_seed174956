Just....[[annoyed]] at [[handling this day]].

Taking care of my barriatric surgery stuff as soon as I get home. I will have Jeannie fill out the form with me and then see what we can do to get it sent off tonight! I'm relatively happy about that.

I am going to get a better workflow going and I am going to try and stick to it. 

Making my bed is going to be a part of it to give myself the feeling of bneing taken care of more than I normally am.

In other words: [[practice makes perfect]] and it's not really going to be "fun" but something [[ruminatative]]
