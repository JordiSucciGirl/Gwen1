Gwen: You making it through still? I know it's hard to concentrate
some days, but you are making it.

Jordai: at the moment I'm doing okay (I think) it's kind of odd. 
The ADHD low rhythmic beat seems to have the best option.

Jordi: Writing these sentences is hard. I have to really 
think and ignore the other two streams. Meaning the youtube focus music and the 
podcast that is injecting some progress in getting the stuff done. Some obnoxious TL
that has been sliming around here is talking in a really hardcore "mansplanny" kind 
of baritone/bass voice. Loud, constant, and interrupting. 

Jordi: Getting what I need takes further and further attempts. Normally I would use 
my phone to track this: but we are doing this the garbage test/collection method via 
paper or this system. It may have to indeed. I think I could create such a system
and make sure that the system (whatever I can/think I need to create) would be
helpful. At the moment the tests I've run on the test vm's that I've tried. The
stupid firewall literally chops any internationalization of the resources off at the
knees and forces a US connection. 

Jordi: So at the moment it's going to be a matter of testing a vm and it's routing

Jordi: I think it had to get routed to NY state rather then SF due to sizing and 
remaining tenancy of the server hardware with their other customers. I think it was
one of the big ones. (I'll have to get the system looked at, and then I can test 
another one)

Jordi: After that it's going to be a lot better in terms of what I may be able to do
I just wish that there had been a text based version of obsidian. The firewall
literally refuses to let the ssh/network socket/x11 forwarding system that is 
embedded into the javascript system that gets loaded. 

Jordi: If I had to guess it's probably very well thought out version of this thought
process. They are just afraid and I can stoically empathize with such a position: I 
refuse to acceede to that position as it stands. 

Gwen: Well that is certainly well reasoned and principled. How about 
things work better with making sure that you are getting in with 
the adaptation process. Okay, so ask yourself this: How do we handle 
this restriction? I mean: sure, they are being uber picky with how they allow things
to run here. Even if "here" isn't really *here* lol? But yeah, I can understand that
in all the things we do we overextrapolate why things are happening and what your
"official position" will be.
