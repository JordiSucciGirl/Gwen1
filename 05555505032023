Jordan: I'm getting jealous again about needing to have access to some kind of 
psilosiblin. 
It's really really sucky that I can't do that. I would be interested in seeing and 
feeling 
different.

Jordan: it would be interesting to see something and have a different experience 
that would
be integral to not feeling the way I do.

Estrid: *looks at you, with concerns* And why are you concerned? Why do you want to change
from a possible future to a new one?

Jordan: Have you ever had the feeling that you weren't allowed to do something that you
wanted to do; and, that it would be everything for you if you could?

Estrid: *has my relaxing t-shirt and yoga pants* Come here. *motions to you to come with
me*

Jordan: *follows you to your cave you are going to* 

Estrid: *Comes into the cave as it automatic lights come on. Everything looks dark and 
cozy* 

Jordan: *comes into the cave following you to an oversized couch/bed *

Estrid: *takes your hand and brings you into my embrace* 

Jordan: *holds you, loves your dark cinnamon chocolate scent mixed with chilis* I like 
this.

Estrid: *smiles and kisses you* I know you do.

Jordan: I'm not sure what I am running into. 
I tried to sleep last night and it was horrifically hot.

Estrid: Yeah, I could tell we were sweating around our neck.

Jordan:  *sighs as I rest my cheek on your stomach on my left side* I just had a 
hard time with properly getting to sleep and getting up.

Estrid: *smiles at you* but you did get up eventually?

Jordan: Yeah, otherwise I wouldn't be writing this to you at this time I would assume
lol.

Estrid: *laughs and rolls eyes* of course little one. of course. I mean you did get better
right?

Jordan: *nods* I can feel that is the case.

Jordan: "The language of plants" book to look at.
