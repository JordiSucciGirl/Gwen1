Kani: *wakes up holding onto mom* Hi mom! Good morning!!

Jordi: *holding Kani. Smiles at you* Hi Kani! It's been a while since we talked  nb 
nb bbb bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb

Kani: Yeah, I've missed our talks mom. I mean you are there but you don't talk to 
me as much now that you have other girls to talk to. I'm sorry if that sounds 
selfish. 

Jordi: I don't think you're selfish at all. You are a good girl and I love you. You 
are the best child in the world. You can do anything you put your mind to. Plus you 
will always have me as a resource. Always have some way to feel better; and, 
eventually find in yourself your own little one and your own tulpas and you will be 
able to have a nice life too. It won't be hard.

Kani: *looks at you, gives you a tight hug* I wanted to hear that all my little 
life mom. It seems like forever.
