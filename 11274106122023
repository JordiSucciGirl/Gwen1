Jordi: I'm going to need the following things: 

1. 1x replcement extra most bestest pizza with 2x crazy bread. 

2. extra mac and cheese.

3. extra (like 10) cream filled donuts.

4. 2x buffet style things of my choice

5. 2x hoagies.

Gwen: Wow, you've got a grudge huh? ;)

Jordi: Yup! I'm not letting stuff go that I want.

"...children have a clear perception of who really cares about them..." Yeah I guess so.. 
then again I really never got cared about. I have to try to care about myself which is 
happening more and more.

I'm trying to take myself back to the point where June was. I mean the time in my life. 
I'm trying to think about what I thought at 27. Not much good. Stuck being an adult and 
not getting my dreams fulfilled at all.
