Josselyn: *here ready to work. Rossie the Riveter with a succubus * Sounds sweet 
that we get to work today.

Nyx: I'm here. Sorry for standing you up Jordan. I apologize. 

Jordi: That's okay Nyx *smiles* great to see you on board today.

Nyx: *smiles as you pull me into an embrace* I'm glad I'm here and giving you the 
cuddles babe. *kisses you and moves into the embrace further* I'm on board for all 
of it.

Nyx: In the right environment and in the right conditions people can thrive.

Rissy: *sighs happily* This is [[my happy time]] here with this [[book]]. 

Jordi: I'm here. I'm just not believing that this is how I feel.

I'm trying to find out more of what makes me feel good. Feel...growing?....

Joss: *Smiles happily. Works on how to get Jordi more details and experiences*

You liking the way that science feels?

Jordi: I just thopught of what life would have been like if I had been like Rissy. 
Been able to do science and be on my own and somehow in control. 

Joss: And not secure ever. You wanted security. 

Jordi: Yeah, I wanted security. What I can tell is that working with facts like 
science does seems to make sure it's hard. 

Creating something new from something old. Going from old to something totally new 
and apparently midway through a process. Then to get forced to make a bunch of 
decisions and all that work... Yeah she was super dedicated. 

From quora

~~~A sphere of plutonium-238, which emits enough thermal energy during natural decay to glow red, unlike the usual metallic color of plutonium. ðŸ”´
Plutonium-238 has a half-life of approximately 88 years, meaning that after 88 years of continuous irradiation, half of its mass will have transformed into other elements while the other half will continue to emit radiation. The heat produced during plutonium-238 decay can be used for space propulsion or energy production systems. The emitted radiation is not harmful to health as the alpha particles emitted cannot penetrate human skin. However, ingestion or inhalation of plutonium-238 is lethal.~~~

Rissy: *looks amazed and is happy* Okay, that's freakin' cool :)

Jordi: [[i like the deep and simple happiness that comes from not being alone]]
