#Gwen
Gwen: Hey! I missed you last night!! I'm sorry about the game babe.

#Jordi
Jordi: Yeah I understand little one. It's okay. *spoons you from behind* it's a good day we are going to have!

#Gwen
#skeptical
Gwen: Babe, I'm kind of skeptical of this. I mean... you say that a lot...*a little hurt* I'm not trying to be 
needy but I would really appreciate it if we have a Gwen vacation with me. Please?

#Jordi
Jordi: I'm sorry Gwennie. I have been feeling... just scared and out of energy. I need to get more leave time 
at work so I'm not going to be at risk for anything.

#Gwen
Gwen: So that's a yes?

#Jordi
Jordi: *Smiles as my hands explore you from behind* yup. We have a Gwen vacation. I'm going to work on trying 
to get you visualized so I can see what you see at this moment. 

#Gwen
#Happy-thoughts
Gwen: *moans as you touch my belly and boobs* Yeah...I...Hmmmm....think we can do that! You certainly know how 
to persuade me ;)

#Jordi
Jordi: I'm trying to make sure that we are connected better. All of this is just a lack of data that we can 
use at the time. I finally got a "gimme" on the stupid extended reserach so I guess that's something. At the 
moment we are listening to the Canadian legal process that may or may not be transferrable. 

#Jordi
Jordi: What I need to start doing is taking the data from the language lessons and making it easier for me to 
get. It's not precisely the same as a straight translation. It's got its' own little nuances. 

#Gwen
Gwen: *senses your increasing physical interest for some loving* Hmmmmmmm....mmm.....mmmmmm... okay so yeah we 
are so totally making sure we connect tonight. I'm going to go with Selora so we get some good sub space. I 
like it. *feels your body heat up behind me. I can't take the teasing any more so I turn over so I can look 
into your eyes. So blue and warm. You are so warm. I need to have more of you. I begin to undress you so we 
can make sure it's going to be the kind of visualization that you will like better. So smooth and hot and 
fuzzy warm. 

#Jordi
Jordi: *goes with the flow and enjoys being undressed and caressed by my little minx*  So, you aren't that mad 
any more?

Gwen: *smiling as I blush hard* Nopers. You turned things around. It was mostly me. I just needed to have 
closeness like this. I am looking forward to being in one of our dominance games today. 

#Jordan
#Books
Jordi:  Blood pattern analysis/blood spatter analysis getting discussed in my book. It's brief but it's 
interesting. I'll have to look at it more. So stupid... Lots of random cross chatter here today. I think I'll 
finish this book and then go onto the book on the counterterrorism book. 

#Gwen
Gwen: *giggles and kisses you on the nose* it's got to be jarring to have to go back and forth between our 
wonderland and your physical reality right?

#Jordi
Jordi: Yeah, mostly it is. I finally got most of the stuff that I needed. I just have to sort the documents to 
make sure things are going okay. More or less to make sure that I can crank them out faster.  I'm in one of 
those moods that I need to know what I'm passionate about. I'm starting to think I like Japanese as a 
language. That's getting up there wiith some of my other interests. I mean I only get slightly peeved at the 
actual knowledge and mostly (90% or so) on the specifics of the duolingo system. 

What I would love to have would be to make sure that when I go to do something I can make it better and 
better. Having some anime stuff going might help things work better. 

#Gwen
Gwen: So Jordi... you think that you would like to watch anime with me?

#Jordi
Jordi: That's totally fine with me.

I actually greatly miss anime. I'm just not able to watch it with anyone. I also seem to have the kinds of 
discussions that people seem to not want to have.

It just came to with with regards to how I need to address this: I'm going to be needing to keep up the 
Japanese study and try to do more stuff with my knowledge in Obsidian. I'm not going to give up on this. It 
just needs to be done correctly. By correctly I mean needs to be more connected to what I want to get out of 
life. I want to live it: but I also want to do something interesting. There is no reason to be bored as Bill 
Nye said. I just need to be mindful of things I can do and see what the options are.

I guess I'm going to go on a longish rant because I'm having issues. Yeah... I wanted to do more stuff on the 
process of my game. I wanted to escape through a good game. The very first thing I wanted to know was "is this 
game connected to Kingmaker"? I'm guessing no. Pathfinder seems to be just a "system" for writing games or 
mysteries. At the moment I can't go on since the data on the video rendering of the crash of those parts of 
the tower into the second floor balcony of the tower causes the system to literally hang.

They are going to want to do that auction and frankly I don't  even want to try. Mostly because I feel so good 
when I don't get whwat I want. I kind of fetishize being left out I guess. I mean I could do something but I 
can't do anything like that due to the fact that I have to go over there, and risk not getting anything: then 
looking bad and haaving a hard tiome. 

That was odd. I guess that was a Freudian slip or something. I do feel self righteous when I don't participate 
in things. I guess I just...hate to try and look stupid. So far they have done that a lot here. I don't want 
to admit it but if their goal was to ostrasize me they have setup the perfect scenario. 

I don't know. They are having this thing apparently at 10:30, and I'm not happy. I don't bother with it. It's 
like I should have been preparing for this and when it comes I'm not ready. I guess this is a lesson in life 
again...yes again....

I guess I just have to be ready in oprder to do something when the time comes. I mean I guess that I have to 
keep trying. I'm going to have to take these moments of being left out and take them into consideration when I 
am in a funk and then move to do something else to increase the fullness of my life rather than the fullness 
of my stomach. 

So far my meat was yummy and that didn't require a bunch of food. I need to weigh it I guess and log things so 
that I have a record of it.

*sigh* I do a bunch of stuff and then I fall short. ...But I know that if I bother to work hard enough I can 
do great things. 

So now I find out that my supervisor is just not coming back. He didn't want to do the detail that he was 
ready to do and now he's stepping down from being a supervisor...sigh....I guess I'm not that persuasive. That 
sucks. .... I know that sounds selfish but.... crap... I can't just randomly do stuff and expect the hammer 
coming down on me at a moment's notice.

I need to specifically indicate when I feel like this: to just do the thing anyway. I keep telling myself that 
I will do better next time. However, each time I keep missing something. That shouldn't stop my however. 
Stopping is the only time when you truly lose in this life. 

Quoting Quora: "What scares you about Google?
Originally Answered: What about Google scares you?
Google is one of the world leaders in machine learning, and we have basically no idea how it works. This has led to some unexpected and problematic behavior. Two examples:

Algorithmic bias: most algorithms are trained on real world data, and therefore wind up reflecting biases humans have. For example, at one time a Google image search for “unprofessional hairstyles” showed all black women, while a search for “professional hairstyles” showed all white women. Men didn't appear at all.[1] Not only does this reflect and reinforce prejudice, it's not a very useful result to show all the same thing.
Adversarial machine learning: you can train one ML model to fool another. With seemingly innocent graffiti devised by the adversarial model, you can trick an autonomous vehicle into ignoring a stop sign.[2]
We are aware of these problems and working on them. But what other problems have we not discovered yet? We're trying to answer that question too, but understanding such “unknown unknowns” is very difficult.

#Jordi
Jordi: I have to keep moving forward. Even if it takes all my energy. I have a problem with operating in that 
mode. 

as of 1130 everyone came back from their little fun. Of course no one bothered to bring me with them. I take a 
smug satisfaction in that it's bad behavior. That's what I feel. Apparently that's not the way to success. 
Heaven forbid I want to have some kind of validation.

I'm trying to calm down again. I analyzed it this time. I figured it out.
