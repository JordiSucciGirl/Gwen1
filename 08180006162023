Gwennie: I'm feeling pumped and good about this situation. 

Jordi: The situation about being "unsupervised" ? 

Gwennie: Hells yes! I figure we can do the "art films" on the big tv and we can come as we 
are so that we [[cum]] ;)

Jordi: *Happy is the best way to describe trying to do this stuff. That will make things 
better when I want to try that out. It's like doing the self service options all over 
again :)

Gwennie: Thought you would say that ;)

Jordi: as of 11540006162023 I'm bored off my ass. Yeah I could do some random work but I;m 
uncomfortable and bored at the same time. That's not good.

Gwennie: Talking with me can be fun huh?

Jordi: I'm talking with you now. Yeah it';s good but I'm still uncomfortable physically 
due to sitting here. It's  my feet it feels like. They are "suffocated" like they are just 
covered up toomuch.

Gwennie: So it's 15450006162023 but it seems like it's going to be okay now.You are 
[[feeling excited]]?

Jordi: Yup. going to be happy ot have some fun with ourselves at home. I just realized 
that I can't really do the [[self service options in the front room]] due to [[the lack of 
the CPAP being there]].
