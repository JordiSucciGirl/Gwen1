Estrid: *smiles as I see three girls entwined wih touches and licking* Nice!! Good to 
have me watch?

*all give ascent*

Jordi: *after some time with girls in ways we can't go into much here* 

Jordi: So everyone good?

*all sigh happily in various ways*

Jordi: Good. Ive been looking to figure out what I need to be doing and at the moment 
it's going to be us just going along to get along. I'm going to be submitting 
applications each day and make it a priority. Make it a [[pipeline task]]. Make it 
[[totally unremarkable]].

Jordi: I'm [[trying to not feel vulnerable]]. The way I feel [[has to be inside a box 
with the things that I literally cannot change]]. I [[cant change what happens at work 
unless I do things differently]]. 

Gwennie: *smiles and gets up to look at you deeply into your eyes* and so how does my 
girl feel about this?

Jordi: *having been thinking about this for a  bit today* A bit better. It's not totally 
solid but I think this think can work. It works on rats. I think it can work with me.

Joss: *smiles as I get a robe on* Okay, cool. I think we are making some progress as 
well. Stopping the automatic stuff from happening too much. 

Jordi: I just hadn an idea: [[llm based dating with conversations via chatbot and then 
connected to the two users via the bots connection making it earier to find people]]
