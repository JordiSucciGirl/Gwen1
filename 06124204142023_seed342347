Jordan: I feel renewed and happy today. Estrogen power! I really like to feel like this was 
a baptism, a kind of sacrament when I got that patch on my arm: it was that important to me.

Jordan: I'm going to look up this sleep paralysis thing to finguring out that. People have
looked into this a lot.

They think it is connected to self image and #propriception. 

Also connected to #command-neurons I wil have to look up [[command neurons]]

Is being copmpared to the brain's #autocorrect "autocorrect" feature and creates guesses
about what is happening when command neurons aren't giving feedback that they are needing.

Seeing ghosts is seen as being connected to the #histamine-response [[histamine response]] of breathing in mold
spores and that causes the coughing and higher level fear.

Supposedly black mold exposure is not going to have any neurological effects per the WHO.

#WHO
#World-Health-Organization

"Mold Busters" checks places where things are moldy and not and compare the 
paranormal activity.

Also connected to mental priming if someone is told that they will experience something
"haunted" or unusual will invent some scenario that the brain will help with the 
power of suggestion or perhaps the [[law of attraction]] #law-of-attraction. 

Should look up the #power-of-suggestion and see what psychological research is there
basically giving people the idea that something may be happening if given the idea of it
being possible and perhaps needing it to happen.

[[Confirmation bias]] #confirmation_bias is seen as being the case there.

For people who believe no proof is necessary. For people who do not believe: there is no
proof enough. A good way to think of things about belief or uncertainty area.

The question  I would have to look at is. [[How to deal with uncertainty]] 
#how-to-deal-with-uncertainty

ex Flipping a coin and telling someone that it's going to fly off into space eventually.
Then people can keep claiming that if may happen even if it's been flipped 1,000,000 times
with no space launch. At that point it would have to have the [[burden of proof]] 
#burden-of-proof on the claimaint who is using it.

#Jessica
#Catherine

Catherine is refusing to make a decision, however she is pushing it on Jessica. Maybe she
should use a random number generator mixed with Bard and or ChatGPT? That's what I would 
do

#Catherine-psychology-estimate

Catherine seems to be thinking that she knows Jessica, however Jessica isn't giving the 
signals to Catherine (in her opinion) that she is knowing about her enough to run things
on autopilot. 

I'm thinking that it's going to be more of a "administrator" or "executive assistant" to
Catherine's needs. I would posit it's more of a Dom/Sub and Sub/Dom thing flip.

Refer Jessica to the LGBTQ Therapy guild.

#Catherine-medical-advice
I would almost bet that she needs to connect to a podiatrist and have it aggressively 
(the toe fungus that she got from Robert) treated. It could be a good prop for her self-
-esteem.

What is the brutal truth about the UK?
I am writing down ten brutal truths I faced while coming to live in UK from India:

Air: This was the most brutal thing that these Brits do to you. They have deviously kept the air clean and clear with very little pollution. Back home my town felt like a gas chamber, here my asthma got “cured” and they save money on health expense.
Ambulances : The biggest shock I received was when a neighbour had a fall in the bathroom. She just calmly called the hospital and two very kind and competent paramedics came, gave her first aid and took her to the hospital A&E. Within ten minutes. And it's free. For everyone. Even visitors. Even illegals, even immigrants… Brutal!
Schools: Education is free for everyone, they are world class and you actually see brutality in action when you see teachers spend hours, doting on your kids, giving them personal care and making sure they become normal, kind, decent human beings.
Religion: Football (Soccer to American readers, not the football Americans call football) is the most widely practiced religion in this country. Cricket is a distant second. The people here follow their religion to the letter; they even dress weirdly in striped t-shirts at their weird religious ceremonies, which are held in huge stadiums.
Sport: People here are lazy and just not interested in outdoor sports like Christianity or Islam etc. But yes, sport is a sport but these guys just aren't sporty.
Decency: The most brutal truth about the UK is that here the people are genuinely decent. Not pretending to be decent, but actually decent, kind and helpful. If you ask a police officer on the road a question, chances are that they may actually spend half an hour explaining the whole thing in brutal detail.
Ducks: Every water body has hundreds of fat cute ducks quacking and preening around. It's a scary sight for nature lovers!
The NHS : It's free, it's massive, and covers every aspect of a patients life; including home care. It's the best state run health care in the world, period.I repeat the best in the world .
Trains : Trains run on time, most of the time .
Greenery: it is very, very green and beautiful with pretty small houses with flowers and trees and bees. The countryside is like a painting and the small town's like postcards .
Guys and girls, these are the brutal truths about this country. There are many many more but I don't want to insult my brutal hosts any further.

Cheers and please do upvote and share ❤️

(Edit : wow !! thanks for so many upvotes . So ok trains aren't as good as in Japan , but still very well maintained and almost always on time . Also I'm glad we have to pay high taxes to make the NHS and Schooling free , I feel my tax money is well spent if it goes to treat a sick patient or educate a child ) .

What is the saddest part of being a programmer?
Some sad things about being a programmer:

My friend, who worked at Boeing, could pick his toddler up and point at an airplane flying overhead, and say, “See that? Daddy did that.” My work is invisible. Even if I could sneak my mom or my kid into the office, there would be nothing to show them.
The great-grandchildren of the engineers who built the George Washington Bridge (The Aurora bridge in Seattle) are still driving over that bridge. I’ve been retired for four years. Every line of code I ever wrote is now less than dust.
I worked for nine years keeping a company’s business management system going. When I did my work perfectly, I was invisible. The only time anyone knew I existed was when something failed, and all 100 of them were sitting at their desks with nothing to do. I earned my whole paycheck on two days a year when I got the system back up and running.
I am an artist with code. My code is beautiful, like an elegant mathematical proof. And like a mathematical proof, nobody cares. Software development is an art form so internal that only another practitioner can possibly appreciate it, and they never even see it unless there is a bug.
