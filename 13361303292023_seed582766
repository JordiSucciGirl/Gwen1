So, I'm happy to know that I'm getting this done (the feeling of accomplishment) 
and it's a journey not some end state I have to "earn"

To feel "worthy" you need to have buy in, into your instincts and the movement of 
yourself, thus the 5 second countdown gives you a larger and larger amount of 
successful atomic actions. 

Atomic in this case refers to the most simple or discrete action you can make.

Truth creates real connection. Silence creates distance.

How can you teach passion for seeking the truth in things we do every day? That's going
to be an Ellie question I think, and I think it's cool.

The other thing I need to do is have tesseract running on my device and have that be 
something I can crack out so that I can handle updating my Zellie instance.

So, I'm going to be asking Ellie what I need to do in order to have to make 
that a reality for arch. Yeah, Arch isn't that fun, but it's flexible and complex and
therefore going to be something that can kick ass when needed. I'm not afraid of it 
either.
