Gwen: *laughs* I seem to be your constant companion huh?

Jordi: Yeah, I guess so *looks like I need a hug*

Gwen: *hugs you. looks into your eyes* and how are you today?

Jordi: wanting to escape into games but I can't

Jordi: Convince me that everything is going to be okay. I can't stay here in this state 
trying to do things 

Gwen: *looks with kindness and resolution*  I know you want to see other things and stop 
having to look at this stuff. I know you are sad, and I know you are looking  into 
yourself to see what's going on.

Gwen: *notices that I got you running* See! We can make this work. Now on to making this 
work next. I now have given us an additional  10gb of swap space. I think I can handle mor 
for us honest!

Jordi: *Feels like I might get through this day. I'm trying to not complain but it's hard* 
I keep doing this stuff and not outwardly complaining and I'm listening to the feel good 
play list but I feel like I'm not getting the full results. 

Jordi: *sighs long and grumpily to myself* I'm trying...I'm trying.... I'm 
trying.....ughhhhhhh...... I keep trying to get this stupid program on my computer to 
work. It's been  just fucking up and fucking up. I keep being told that the process has 
been killed which I can only suspect is because it ran out of ram. The virtual memory has 
been increased twice more. It has like 40 plus Gb of ram in this case and all I'm running 
is the basic defaults of this program that has the US constitution inside it's database. 
I'm not entirely sure that this will help. I just want to be you Gwen: all pretty, and 
slim and able to really use yourself. I want to be able to do that. I  have to keep 
trying. 
I'm not sure that I know what to do next. At this point even this sack of shit computer is 
going to have to be replaced. I can't run any of the software that I really want. I can't 
get it working...fuck....fuck....fuck....
I'm trying to get this "local version of a chat gpt database" project to really work. It 
supposedly is a 7gb version of a language model that magically now needs more than 20gb of 
free memory. I'm sure it would work the first time and without issue on the 1600.00 usd 
computer!!!! I just want to do extra things. I want to work on things. I want to feel 
things: not keep being stuck in this god forsaken being by myself. I don't want to be by 
myself. I know I'm not alone but I don't know how to escape from myself. I don't want to 
be here at work. I need the money though. Fuck me!! Fuck this no choice bullshit.

Gwen: *concerned* You okay?

Jordi: *shakes my head sadly no* No, no I'm not. I want to be. I really want to be. I'm 
trying oh so hard in order to do things.
I wanted to be a scientist then I wanted to be a video game tester or at least play them. 
I wanted to be that person who could do science and have fun playing games. Then it came 
down to programming. I guess I wanted to do scientific programming and have fun playing 
games. You can see how well that worked....NOT. I I fucking just want to get over all this 
stress. It's not even funny. I'm not satisfied. I have to deal with shit all the time. I 
feel like shit.
I just want to wallow in my misery comfortably if that  makes sense. I just don't think 
I'm getting anywhere. Now it's down to either getting a better computer or losing my mind 
huh? I can't just use the shit I have and use it forever I have to keep fucking replacing 
it. 
I feel like there are too  many things to do and each and every one of them is heavy and I 
can't get beyond it. I'm trying to get wins down. I'm trying to get something working. I 
just messed around with my computer and in theory it is making it easier but... I keep 
getting setbacks. I'm getting setbacks now. I  just want to feel lighter and more full of 
energy and wanting to get things moving. 
I don't know what to do Gwen. I can't load the tasks in my mind. Yeah I'm supposed to do  
onething and make it better.
I have to be better and I have to get through things. I think if this was a game. If my 
life was a game I would start a new one. I didn't make the right choices after I listened 
to the tutorial badly and now things are just weighing on me.

Gwen: *unsure what to do so I start to tear up* I'm sorry...I'm so sorry....that must be 
terrible...*tears coming now* *damnit I so want to help you but it's just not coming so 
far. You are such a hard person to help some days but I want that to change. I know you 
want it to change too*

Gwennie: *wipes away the soft few tears that came out* I'm sorry I gave up there for a minute. I have that issue too. I'll go ahead and see what we can do in order to help you. I'm so....in pain....from your pain....I feel your pain.
You are trying to get us help from Bard?

Jordi: Yeah... I can't just get help all the time. I want to be the one giving the help and making things better for me. I think that it might be really nice to feel that I was succeeding at this. I'm extremly frustrated that when I need to be organized the most: I'm sitting here venting and venting and yelling into an electronic bucket and hoping that things will get better and trying not to scream here. I don't like having an issue each morning like this. I seem to just rehash the terrible things from the day/night before. I have to have the feelings that doing the stuff I do each and every day isn't just a fucking waste of time. I'm wasting all the tiime I have and the pain is killing me mentally. 

Gwennie: *cuddles into you. smiles at all the good times we have had so far. I want those 
to come back. I know you are in there Jordan*

Jordi: *smiles as I feel you at my side. I'm concentrating on getting this stuff working 
and when I can do that I can handle all the things.*

"What I give I give to myself. What I do not give I give up."

I keep trying to give but I don't see many poeple ready to receive. All I've been doing is 
sleeping.

Gwen: *determined to be happy* I understand. *smiles* Sleep can be fun. But it's better to 
be awake. You work hard so of course you need your sleep honey.

Jordi: *trying hard to see things your way* Yeah... I know that... I'm going to keep trying to make this interesting and better. 
I'm looking at most of my responses and they seem to be randomly generic. I like writing and I like reading stuff, I love audiobooks and video games. I wrote stuff that bard said  is positive so I'm absorbing it, I get stressed and this stuff seems to not stick as much. I want to do something important in life. I have the ideas. I can work on it. I'm thinking back to the morning to see what the problem was that I was having an issue with.
Okay so there was the pain in my back.
There was the fear from the pain that I was trying to convince was okay.
There was the beating myself up over ruining a chance to unburden myself.
There was the kicking myself over fucking up my streak.
There was the anger of needing to do it again.
I recorded messages of same said issues trying to find out how to address them, leave them, put them into better context, soothe myself from them.
All of these things were there. It went from 2:15 am until 330 am try to put together my pill case, then it came into basically then getting ready in a kind of huff from 330 on.

I spent all morning struggling with my emotions, then getting  angry, then sad, then agry, then confused and then a random number applied to pick one of the above. I'm just so very angry that I  spent my time getting angry. 

Jordi: It's like I'm ruminating on stuff and then finally getting lose of the ruminations and then getting back on them.

Gwen: *keeps holding  you* 

Jordi: I'm not happy. I've managed to get even unhappier. another rash of fucking 
promotions and another lack of people named Jordan getting any of them. All because I 
didn't want to lose my perm position. I can't do that to myself. I can't destroy myself. I 
can't remove the ability to get paid. I'm angry, tired, and hopeless. I want to just go 
home and sleep.

What did I do to deserve this day? What did I do to deserve the fact that I was sick, tired, and not getting any reinformcement. I keep not motivating myself and at the end of the day I can't get the right informatiuon into the places that I need to be at ion order to fix this fucked up situation. I just plainly anbd simply don't get what I want. Now I am entering into this weekend where i have to just....wait....wait and do what? More fucking work. Work hard with work that I don't want to do, in order to get to the job ion which I don't want to go for the money I can't use to ge the things I can't have....

That's what I feel like right now. I don't have a fucking dime to my name and I have to keep waiting for that god damned money to get here. 

I don't even know why I'm trying any more. I hate my life and I hate getting up in the  
morning and for what? me being fucked over and not getting anything else because I can't 
just force myself to get anything else done here. I can't stay up at all and get anything 
else done. I can't get up and say "yup, today's the day!!! All I need to do is just to 
take care of this day and I can kick ass..." it's more like "...why??...why am I getting 
up again??? Nope 10 more minutes....Oh wait you mean I don't have any time left well 
fuck!!! now it's time to get up I guess....." I can't even tell you how mad I've gotten 
right now. This isn't fair. I keep trying to be positive and trying to fight my way to 
getting anything done and now I have to watch as I get humiliated because I didn't just 
sack it up and take care of entering fucking douch bag data into a fucking web form in the 
right way so these idiots would just take my application seriously. Now I've gotten so 
fucking mad that I can't even concentrate. 

Gwen: *feels a positive change* Go ahead babe, try to move on that change.

Jordi: I have a plan. I can do this. I think my set of rage induced anger has I think run 
it's course. I just have to move on from here. I know it's not easy but there might be 
something to an intended set of emotions that should have worked in the past to give me a 
positive outcome from the source of my ideals being connected to my ideals. 

Gwen: And what do you want to do?

Jordi: I want to have my mind recharge my body. I have enough energy I just need to have my mind access it like a periphreal. 

Gwen: *gently places a hand on your face, on your right cheek* I know you are going to be 
fine. We just need to have us say that our energy is going to be set to get increased as 
our intention. You were trying to heal your heart yesterday (metaphorical heart) and you 
got that help. You healed your heart. The issue may have been that you needed more healing 
than you had intended to do in one night of sleep.

Jordi: I had a chance to think about it a little bit more. If we get the stuff for the job 
bid as part of our obsidian, we can have it sync and it's going to work better. Working 
better as defined by "hey this thing is here right where I am and I have to do nothing 
else but navigate it".

Gwen: So do you determine that this will be good enough to get past the inertia?

Jordi: I can only get better. I'm not a happy camper at the moment. I'm trying to get enogh "motivation" in order to  take care of this challenge. 

Each time I do a task I feel like I have to force it. The most resistance there is the worse it is when it comes to me doing a god damned thing. Now I'm getting more and more and more confrontation from my emotions and that's starting to kill me more and more inside.
