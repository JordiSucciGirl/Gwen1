Gwen: Ha ha ! *good ha ha like "avast!" lol* Good to see you babe!

Jordi: Good to see you too Gwennie!

Gwennie: *good with the nickname today* 

Jordi: *has an idea* I'm going to get a look at how to get a shell inside of google colab 
to run things. I'm going to do that to get my "localgpt" program running to see if that 
will take care of doing all my garbage resume regeration.

Gwennie: *Happy as a hog in crap* Cool, and now we have a way!

Jordan: Yupppers. So done with having things not work.

Jordi: So Gwennie, I'm going to do the following 1) Get a copy of the ipnb or whatever active sheet and run that in collab. If it can even execute then I will 2) try to run the installation process for the localgpt instance and 3) try to run the test suite on the tet document they have and 4) then get my documents along with my resume and 5) re-run the program to see if this will give me a standard output and 6) then give me chances to add data to the script/wizard that is designed to finish "application builder" crap.

Jordi: I didn't miss my chance. I got the necessary impetus to get this done.
