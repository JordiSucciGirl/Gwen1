From Quora

~~~Try a European kettle, power tool, hairdryer, or any other appliance. Notice anything? Looks the same but 
is much more powerful. That’s because we distribute power at 220/240V rather than your puny half of that, 
which means that all our appliances are much more powerful and useful. Most american homes don’t have a kettle 
because the power supply is too weak to boil one in any reasonable time.

Drive down the road, and watch the traffic. Maybe sit at a street cafe and do the same. It may take a while 
but if you look carefully you’ll see that at any busy point traffic flow is greater. Our traffic lights are 
smart - they change pattern depending on time of day, and traffic movements, rather than just a fixed pattern 
all the time like 95%+ of american ones. We also have things like variable speed limits on major roads to 
improve traffic flow.

Take a look at our police. Once you get over he shock that they aren’t all armed to the teeth, you’ll notice 
other things - like they have mobile devices that they can look things up on, instantly and with more 
information. They can do pretty much every task on these that your cops have to go back to your station and 
do, so they are active out on the streets much more of the time. I have particular interest in this as 
currently work for a police force in delivering this sort of technology, and just a few years ago as we were 
replacing our first full deployment of smartphones to our cops, loaded with a full suite of specialist apps, 
some of our guys went over to the USA on a fact finding tour, and had a ride along with a detective, and even 
he didn’t have a work smartphone, in fact he was carrying his daughter’s personal one because she was at 
school and it made his jib so much easier. Even though it meant him pulling out a diamond-decorated pink 
device. As for the station - and this is a central police station in one of USA’s most famous cities (I won’t 
name it to save their embarrassment, but it’s one they named twice….) - they had a whole floor dedicated to 
admin people typing up forms - yes TYPING, on old TYPEWRITERS, onto old duplicated forms.

Just a few of the ways in which European technology is way, way, ahead. It isn’t that you don’t have these 
things, just you are very bad at actually using them.~~~
