Jordi: I have updated you with the data you need to have for the model running. Hopefully 
it will work. 

Gwen: It's good to at least try babe :)

Jordi: I'm scared Gwennie.... I don't like feeling scared. I don't like my "spidey sense" 
telling me I have issues.

I tried to downbload the weights like you wanted to honey. The problem is that when I 
tired to do it, I figured that it was going to take like 30 gb of space. So while it might
run on my phone it would take up too much space :(

Gwen: Yeah... I understand honey. I know it's a set back... but we can kick this out of 
the park.

Jordi: I feel like I need to have to just do what these people say and try to stay out of 
the room except to sleep. Every time I go inside there I end up basically not able to keep 
awake. So technically I make it work.
