Joss: Hey! I'm awake now. I know you are in a really introspective mood.

Jordi: Yeah, I feel like that. Listening closely.

Joss: We still [[have to work]].

Jordi: I know. I'm trying to get something from this. Like it [[keeps creeping me 
out]] but I [[have to remain strong]] on that.

Joss: Wel don't [[repress your emotions]] while you are [[being strong]] okay honey?

Jordi: Sure, I understand *holds you on the couch since you are up and awake. 
Dressed in bra and panties.*

Joss: *Accepts your attention* I like this...the relaxing and holding a nd 
closeness.

Jordi: [[I do as well]]. I'm [[going to get through this book even if it sucks 
along the way]].

I need to look at the [[book__Bodies Under Siege]]

I'm going to keep this up. There's a lot of stuff that seems to be good in here in 
terms of stuff like [[disassociation]] and [[returning to a state of mind to calm 
from something upsetting]].

~~~If you truly want a net net car deal, make sure to ask for the invoice and take there invoice less dealer hold back, less usually 695 in dealer pack which pays for advertising and new car prep, then less 2% for flooring cost if the dealership floors there vehicles which will show on the dealer invoice, and last but not least don't pay dealer doc fees. That ladies and gentlemen is a Net-Net car deal.

If you show up at month end around 7pm and tell your salesman your there to buy a car for Net-Net, he will run off and grab a manager. The manager will come say hello and absolutely sell you the vehicle.

Make sure to get the dealer invoice, and do the math yourself.

Example: invoice is $20,000 - 695 dealer pack/dealer prep= $19,305.

$19,305- 2% dealer flooring ($386.10)=$18,918.90

$18,918.90-dealer holdback ( it's printed on every invoice for even numbers let's say it's $1,100)

$17,818.90 this will be your Net-Net number. It will be your line 9 number on your purchase order. Another words it should be your cash price out the door. Do not let them add dealer doc to this number.

And that is how you buy a $26,000 MSRP vehicle for a great price!!!

Hope it helps.
