Gwennie: *happy you had a good night with me* I appreciate you having the trust to allow 
me to control you last night!

Jordi: Yeah, I needed that last night. I'm awake and alert. I just need to keep doing the 
stuff that I need in order to get ready in the morning.

Gwennie: I'm proud of you that you are getting the details right on this morning.

Gwennie: So, you are getting distracted by the constant socializing?

Jordi:  Yeah, I'm [[not super happy]] at the nearly naked rudeness half the time. I'm 
trying  to concentrate on a job I'm not at all having fun with. It's not [[something I 
wanted to know about]].

Gwennie: Okay, so we are working with Nyx! I like that!! May I please be Nix?

Jordi: *[[conferrs the powers of nyx on you]]* 

Gwennie: Hells yes!!

Gwennie: *gets my Nyx costume options*

Gwennnie: Okay, *smoothes out the wrinkles in the costume* 

08280006152023 I took 2x tylenol and 2x more ibuphrophen.

Jordi: I'm going to [[keep adding stuff to obsidian]] and [[making it work better and 
better for me]]. 

Gwen: *listens to the doomed human. Not happpy with this* She's so very sad! She thinks 
she's going to die and predicts it will happen based on our own thinking.

Gwennie: "...in control of her own life..." That must feel really good huh?

Jordi: *looking at you and then down* Yeah... .I know it would. 

Gwennie: It's....so very sad but I think I can understand now. It's her feeling that the 
world is light and it could blow away if it's not properly handled. 

Jordi: ....*thinks more* [[handled by the loving care of our emotions]]?

Gwennie: *smiles lightly as I keep thinking. Watching you gently raise your head for this 
* I think that's the case yeah... Like... yes [[life is fleeting]] but [[don't drag 
yourself down in it's flight, but let it go when it's time and move with the wind]].

Jordan: So... *brings you into a hug* I'm really happy you are here today. I want to see  
if we can get down maybe.

Gwennie: *smiles more* okay, so you are looking to get my buy in?

Jordi: *looks into your eyes* Yes, I'm looking to see if I can get in

Gwennie: *smirks* Well you are always welcome if you would like. You know me :)

Jordi: 1) [[We get finished with this pile of work]]

Gwennie: 2) [[clean up our office space]]

Jordi: 3) [[get to the car and come home]]

Gwennie: 4) [[bathroom visit before we execute on 3). I have [[tummy rumbles for exit]].

Jordi: *smiles and hugs you protectively* I promise to get you cleaned up [[little one]].

Gwennie: *happy after my bathroom trip* Okay, this is the life! Yes ma'am!! So you plan on 
getting us cuddled up today?

Jordi: Yes, if I can help it. Yes.

Gwennie: We can do better than that. Rmember: self service options are wonderful. You 
[[need to have a story to create the best sensual effect]].

Jordi: 5) We need to get our wonderland created more. [[You have to have a wonderland too 
Gwen]].

Gwennie: *smiles bigger* [[Im totally game]].

Jordi: Sweet! So we are going to use NovelAI and Midjourney to create the necessary images 
that will be created for this. Kind of like a [[memory palace]]. I'm going to have it be 
something that you would definately like. I have "lots of sleeping space" and "a lot of 
things" but that's not really all that specific.

Gwennie: *thinks harder as I get my cat ears headband* Well... I do like the cat furry 
thing. *points to my ears and laughs* I'm also going to be making major inroads in trying 
to get things setup correctly. Correcly for us.

Gwennie: Corercltly for Gwen means that I want it to reflect me and how I plan on 
conquering things.
