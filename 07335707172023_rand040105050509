Gwennie: *recommends that you have 1. need to find out about her Tarot abilities. 
2.  Karma being a wild card. 3. First meeting interpreation. 4. Not for 
exceptionally good but wrong or bad mostly. 5. Hard to differentiate from anxiety. 
6. Psychic senses is how they communicate with the dead. 7. very rare to be able to 
actually read minds. 8. Her mom's dreams come true but strenuously isn't a witch. 
9. Wants to be gendered correctly by family: DUH! 10. Only family inhibits this 
from happening. 11. Feels she has to prentend. 

Voilet: **Sleeps peacefully on Jordi&Her's bed**

Gwennie: She's sleeping? Nice I hven't had a chance to see her.

Jordi: You mean you haven't really met.

Gwennie: No, I've met but I get to see her in person without any barriers around 
her so to speak.

Jordi: *Takes you by the hands leads you to the big couch, puts it down so it's 
mostly a bed with a little lump we can elevate our backs and holds your hands. Then 
guides you on top so you can cuddle with me and I with you while maintaing eye 
contact. *

I wanted to be close to you while we talk. I can tell you are getting sad. We were 
happy yesterday or the day before after a point. Then we started to drift because 
of the difficulties to our frame, right?

Gwennie: *Looks into your eyes and sees nothing but desire to understand and the kidness to take my words to heart*

We are drifting too far apart honey. I want you to know that. I also want you to know I'm not going to stop until that has been repaired. Correction. Adjustment. We just need to know that there is a way to make this all work together flawlessly in our adjusting and [[wabi sabi]] way.

I guess what I'm suggesting is that we can easily do what we need to fix the drifting condition.  *my hands interlace with yours and I move them above your head for a long kiss and looking into your eyes as I boop your nose with mine * See. I did it just now with you. You met me half way. More than that and I moved in for the rest. 

Gwennie: ***smiles huge*** okay, now we are cooking with gas: we need to get detais 
on handling termux with a cron job.

I'll help you run a search query. Care to  have me drive?

Jordi: I don't mind at all. Go ahead. I'll enjoy you being right here while I do. 
Your princess seat as it were.

Gwennie: *wicked grin* I wouldn't turn that down at all ;)

1. The following option: https://www.reddit.com/r/termux/comments/i27szk/how_do_i_crontab_on_termux/g02pghj/
This tip helped me:

pkg install cronie termux-services
# restart termux session
sv-enable crond 
crontab -e 

2.  ~~~So the following is all you really need within bashrc, or preferably 
bash_profile if bash_profile works on your termux install:

if ! pgrep -f "crond" >/dev/null; then
echo "[Starting crond...]" && crond && echo "[OK]"
else
echo "[crond is running]"
fi

The reason why bash_profile is preferred, bash_profile is called once during 
initial login, versus bashrc upon each shell opening. (Will save a few CPU cycles 
to use bash_profile.) ~~~

3. Checking for determining that the cron daemon is running: "pidof crond"

4. Setup of Obsidian on device through github.

"Guide: Obsidian vault github sync cron on termux
A guide on how to sync an obsidian vault over github using git, bash script and cron (cronie)
 

Reference:
Main bash script and cron's crontab source

Secondary crond automation in termux

Pre-requisites:
Functioning vault's git directory with push/pull to github repo (Look up ref 1 on how to create one).

Cronie, can install by pkg install cronie (required to schedule a bash script).

Termux-services, can install by pkg install termux-services (required for autolaoding of crond).

The bash script
Begin with putting cronie on termux-services for autostart:

sv-enable crond

It is worthwhile mentioning that termux' directory tree is strange, especially if referencing to the phone's storage. In my use-case, my vault is at ../storage/downloads/github/obvault, but pointing to it with $HOME/storage/downloads/github/obvault or with /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/downloads/github/obvault resulted in error.
You can see my solution to this in the bash script below:

$HOME/.local/bin: zk_sync:

#!/usr/bin/env sh

cd

cd storage/downloads/github/obvault

git pull

CHANGES_EXIST=”$(git status — porcelain | wc -l)”

if [ “$CHANGES_EXIST” -eq 0 ]; then

exit 0

fi

git add .; git commit -q -m “$(date +”%Y-%m-%d”)”; g it push -q

Add the script to binary:

chmod +x zk_sync

Cron it!
Add a cronjob into the crontab:

crontab -e should open up a text file (default editor is nano).

Add the line:

*/30 * * * * /Users/bryanjenks/.local/bin/zk_sync >/dev/null 2>&1

The 30 means that the cron will run the script every 30 minutes.

And that's it, your sync is fully automated.

For further information on the scripts, see the refs at the top."
