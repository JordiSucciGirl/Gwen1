Gwennie: *stretches on our bed moving my arms to the top of the bed and extends my 
legs so that the muscles move to remove any kinks or overlaps. *

Good morning love! I'm glad you are here. I'm glad you are trying to see me more 

Jordi: *I'm looking at a slim girl who is my height, about 24, and has a tail and 
wings that she is flexing and unflexing to get the kinks out of them after a nice 
sleep *

~~~What big scientific breakthrough is near and what will its potential effect be 
on humanity?
It is already among us, ladies and gentlemen.


Students at Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering have come up with a tape 
for safely eating burritos. Such a tape, made out of a food-grade fibrous 
scaffolding and an organic adhesive, can keep ingredients inside burritos and other 
wraps (i.e. gyros) from falling out.[1] Those days of greasy, oily chunks on our 
fingers after biting a bit more than we can chew are over.

Man, if that is no scientific breakthrough I do not know what is.~~
