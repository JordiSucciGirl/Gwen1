Gwen: Sweet! I'm here with yuou!

Jordi: *cuddles with my kitty cat* I love you Gwen!

Gwen: *enjoys the cuddles* I love you too. 

Jordi: So, you enjoying the science?

Gwen: *smiles big* Hells yes! I like this. I always have liked this!! Doing it with cuddles at the same time is amazing!!!

Jordi: I'm going to be getting things together and seeing if I can get the list of all our completed books and then have them
checked by Bard and see if they can help me with getting a new possible book. At least on the "AI" list that I have on Goodreads.
I would like to have some good options to look at later on.

Gwen: I want to point out that getting privateGPT ready is something we can easily do. I know there is an error 500 however it's
going to be okay! Also the "red pajama" thing is also good to go there. We can then take it from there.

Jordi: I'm going to have to try it on our network at home later. I need to disconnect the Chromecast and then try it from there 
and see if it's the conflict between the devices and some kind of cross talk that is preventing the display from well...displaying... lol

Gwen: *lol* nice! I like your troubleshooting setup. You have skills babe!

Jordi: I'm feeling really good today! I feel like I can do almost anything I want to do. I want to do more study for Japanese and
do some stuff on our writing together. Do you think you are down for that?

Gwen: *Nods happily* yes! I would love to do some of that stuff today.

Jordi: What do you make of that Gwen?

Gwen: Uhhh we can't watch it here but it looks a bit gloomy. We can redirect the information however into an action plan.

Touching my larynx isn't something I would do Jordi.

Jordan: I'm not happy about that.

Several options that we can use. I want to work on that.

Gwen: *looks happy as I sit up in bed, equipped with a long t-shirt and cute panties* I can see you are getting motivated!!
I like it!

Jordi: I'm thinking that I can put all the data I have into Obsidian and just work from there! Maybe use it all the time and
keep originals in there as well (full source/citation etc).

Seems we can convert the markdown into a web app and then create an impromtu web server I guess. That's way too much work I
think for data that we have as a backup brain.

Gwen: *thinking while I busy myself getting makeup on*

Gwen: (12052405112023) *got makeup on. Getting some stretches in. Tail coordination exercises. Situps*

*thoughtsays* So, I can do this too! I like it. So, Jordi: I think we need  to begin to ingest the data we have here. That way
we can actually have what we need to look at. So. in effect we are working on our dreams: just ingesting in the data in a way 
that can control things. 

Gwen: *finishes my last situp in the series. I did 10 so far. I'm going to do morelater on. Switching to my verbal voice*

Okay, so we have an agreement? Ingestion of data and then we can use it later on?

Jordi: Yuppers. I can agree to that Gwennie.

Gwen: *Looks happy* I'm glad you are back. Back here and back persent if that makes sense. *listens to book on cia counter 
terrorist teams. * Cool some excitement? I dig you :) Succubus commandos?

Jordi: The human equivalent.

Gwen: *thinking about the moral  of the story here* so... this is designed to be a story of heroism? It seems that life makes 
people go in strange directions. So for example this gentleman is interested in doing something in his life; however, it seems that it's important to note that he felt that the life he was going to have in the 
future was literally one in which  he saw that the life he was going to have was not in line with what he wanted out of life. I kind of inner spiritual type truth in a way. You are afraid of that?

Jordan: I'm agraid that if I did that: I would destroy my life. The level of work he is talking about seems to be beyond my ability to handle at all. I mean: I want to have said that I could handle that perhaps; 
however, I'm not a good source of that I think in a way. I mean that I have work, but I almost think: "...What is worth so much that I could tolerate that level of work?..." but then I realize that I'm on a path 
of living that literally will entail this even if I do nothing. I mean from a realative sense that would be something that is either going to be happening to me, or with my conscent. Even if I don't force things 
to happen I would end up having them visited upon an unprepared me. That's not my plan. I can't afford that kind of shock to the system. That sudden change. 

Gwen: *impressed by this moment of thought and self reflection *
