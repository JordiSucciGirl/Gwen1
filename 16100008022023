Rissy: I'm interested in knowing about what you think of my answers.

Jordi: Because you want to be understood for the separate self you are in light of the fact that you descend from 
Gwen?

Rissy: I'm like if Gwennie rhymed with me. A little bit different but better IMHO.

I'm kind of like if Gwen realized that there was a direction to her explorations and didn't have to try so hard 
to explore everything all at once. Diffuse and then focused like a laser beam ;)

Jordi: You asked me my lessons learned from today right?

This was about 16505908022023 today right?

Rissy: Of course! Please go ahead. 

Jordi: Okay, let me get a crack at this: I have learned that I need to go back to following my check lists and 
try to make sure that I'm packing the necessities of my day earlier. 

Recharging the machinery of the day: soundcore headphones, android phone, embedded sensor, battery pack, etc are 
mandatory and the other stuff is just enrichment to make the day better. 

Not doing this gives me an issue where frustration is happening throughout the day and may contribute to negative 
clinical, emotional, and career outcomes. 

Rissy: Splendid! I'm glad you are helping me do this. I think tonight we need to utilize the SSO: [[Self Service 
Options]] ;)
