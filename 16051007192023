Rissy: *I'm quiet now but I don't want to  be that way forever. I was  wild once. I feel wild now. Like I'm free 
but at the same time I'm not entirely bad off. I am cuddling with you on a forest situated bed with a tent that 
is made of an advanced porous but water tight and temperature regulated material* 

I'm liking that you got excited about that antenna thing. You can learn more and more about stuff by making it 
happy to you.
