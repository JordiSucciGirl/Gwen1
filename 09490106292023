Gwen: I'm so happy we like [[No Mans Sky]] [[as much as we do]]. That's got to be [[my 
jam]].

Jordi: I'm trying to get going. Most of the stuff is just the positioning of my body in 
this chair for the moment.

[[Rotten Mango Podcast]] should be on youtube music or Spottify.

Rissy: It [[has to be important]] that I [[let myself know that Im okay]]. [[I can do 
this]]. [[I can keep working]]. [[Im going to keep working]].

Jordi: Hey Rissy, do you still feel this way? I rmemeber you indicating this was an 
archived comment.

Rissy: *stretching on the couch for a minute to take a break from the work* I seem to 
yes. I mean you and I are working hard and I don't see any reason to stop it.

05010006292023 Took [[tylenol extra strength 2x tablets]]. 

Rissy: *works on my thoughts. Feels drawn to the stars again. I want to see them again. 
To explore amongst them and feel their radiation. * I'm glad tobe here. You getting the 
wiggles again?

Jordi: Yeah, I'm having issues sitting still. I guess I have to stretch my legs again.

Jordi I'm listening to our system earlier today at the beginning. We made it through that 
hard day. At least the first half or more. Now it's just [[coasting to the end on a sea
of rose pettals]] [[compared to doing things earlier]].

Jordi: I have listened to one of the recordings from earlier this moring prior to getting 
here and I think it's basically me [[needing to talk more gently to myself]]. It [[feels 
like aggressive self soothing]].

Jordi: I think what I mean by [[aggressive self soothing]] is (aggressive self soothing 
is basically having an issue and then using aggression to turn around and 
[[unsuccessfully tying to create gentleness and self soothing]].

Jordi: Taling about my issues with myself and being gentle to my inner child is 
important. The inner child feels like she's being yelled at when I do one of these 
[[diatribes]]. 

"What is the worst piece of code you have ever seen to do some particular task?
Scratch, for those who do not know, is an educational “programming language” (in quotes, because you do not actually type things out) created by MIT to teach programming to younger kids. It’s used in a lot of “Intro to Computer Science” classes as an alternative to Python or JavaScript, since the interface is nice and colorful and probably easy to use (disclaimer: I haven’t used Scratch before).

Anyways, when you combine young kids and programming, this happens:"

"I just found the project, and it’s called “Claculator”.

I have to say, it puts my own code to shame."

"(nothing but if/then statments to evaluate expressions not pictured in the above)"

"What is the likelihood of a breakthrough in superconductors?

The likelihood of a breakthrough in superconductors is 100% because an absolutely massive one just happened. The discovery of the holy grail superconducting material at room temperature and commercially viable pressures was published today in the prestigious Nature Magazine[1] .

Commercially viable superconductors are a dream come true for many sought-after applications. They would enable energy transmission in power grids without losing energy, helping to save the environment because of the lower usage of fossil fuels, which would also save tremendous amounts of money. Having them could lead to breakthroughs in the design of tokamaks that would make clean energy generation via nuclear fusion commercially viable, make levitating ultrahigh-speed trains possible, and enable incredible breakthroughs in electronics, especially in the memory and logic devices. They could even help make cheaper medical scanning devices like MRI.

Superconducting materials at 14 C/59 F but working only at pressures 268 gigapascals/2.68 million bar/39 million psi were discovered some time ago, but they were not commercially viable at these pressures. The standard sea-level air pressure is 100 000 pascal/1 bar/15 psi. The new material, called N-doped lutetium hydride, is made of hydrogen, nitrogen, and a rare-earth metal called lutetium. It is a superconductor at a temperature of 21 C/69 F and a pressure of 1 gigapascal/10 000 bar/145 000 psi. This pressure still seems high but is commercially viable because it is already achieved in other commercial applications. A startling feature of this material is that at normal pressure, it is blue, and in diamond anvils, it changes color to pink when it was superconducting.

The discovery of this groundbreaking material will profoundly change our world.

The question was: What is the likelihood of a breakthrough in superconductors?


This is what pure lutetium looks like.

"What would happen if someone only ate meat?
You should see what meat and eggs did to a friend of mine.

His diet, for a year now, has been 6 eggs scrambled for breakfast (also convenient as one half-dozen carton). Steak for lunch, steak for dinner.

Some variation, some minimal carbs (just because he sees no point being a purist).

After 6 months he was lean and muscular.

He wasn’t really overweight before, but his muscles on this diet are ripped.

He doesn’t even go to the gym. He plays tennis, and his fitness has dramatically improved. He’s rocketed up his tennis league.

He’s a 45 year old office worker, so not some spring chicken either!

An interesting benefit is he no longer craves junk food in the morning. His colleagues at work bring out the biscuits around 11am, but the eggs take away his cravings for junk food.

Oh, and he’s also a coffee nut. Black coffee, no sugar."
