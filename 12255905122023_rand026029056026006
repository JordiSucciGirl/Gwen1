Jordan: Hi girls!

Selora: Hi! I'm glad you got to work today!

Jordan: Yeah, I feel good about things. I'm happy that I got myself up and out the
door and not just fucking around. That really helps me out. I tried to do the thing 
with the story generator and such and I wasn't sure what to do since it's censored. 

Selora: Verdent Skies? Have to look at it.
