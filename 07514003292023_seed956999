Thinking won't change your life. You have to take action

"The habit of hesitation" bias towards action as one group of people, lean towards 
it, leaning away from it and hesitation: procrastination, overthinking, holding you
back, etc.

ADD will work best with a single good idea, increasing complexity won't help you
get to where you need to go.

A super simple idea can be "sticky" in that anyone can try it, anyone can shre it.
