Rissy: *dances rhythmically to the music. My hair in a set of braids for you* So you are harshing on the humans again? ;)

Jordi: When they are acting the fool yes. :)

~~~Quoting Quora: 

Why is C++ used at all now that a faster language (Go) has been created?
Just wanted to throw in two cents about binaries from GO supposedly being faster than C++. Recently C++ compiler made my jaw fall to the floor. At my job I have heard a riddle whether modern c++ compilers would be able to convert this recursive function into a loop, at sufficient optimization level. (AFAIK most programming languages would not do that)

int sum(int n) { 
	return n ? sum(n-1) + n: 0; 
} 
Generally the answer is yes, gcc or icc would make loop of it and, with extra optimization, unroll it a couple of times. But then one tried clang 5.0, and it produced an arithmetic series summation formula, making this function O(1)!

One could argue that this is just a cheap trick… the thing is there could be thousands of such “cheap tricks” in C++ compilers… And you need long years of well planned development to put such “cheap tricks” in production. ~~~
