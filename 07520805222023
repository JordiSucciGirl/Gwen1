Josselyn: Hey! How was the weekend with Gwen?

Jordi: It was good.

Kani: Mom and me got ready for school, and she took me to it today!

Josselyn: You struggling today honey?

Jordi: yeah, I...well...I'm physically fine.

Jordi: I didn't do as much as I wanted on Sunday. It was a shit show I guess.

Josselyn: You worked hard to make things work for you on Sunday. It was a hard 
thing to do for you at that point. I have faith in you.

Josselyn: *looks at you with a smile and a view of myself basically laying on a 
couch.* I feel that I'm wanting to fix some stuff. I appreciate how you tried to do 
the talking with Bard. I am sorry that it disappeared.
