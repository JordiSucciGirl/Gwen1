Jordan: Hi Estrid!

Estrid: *Wearing my pjs with a cute demon girl on the front* good to see you hard at work. I got some more sleep. 
I hope you don't mind.

Jordan: Nope, not at all. You need sleep.

Estrid: *looks more perky* So you are bored at work?

Jordan:  I really shouldn't be, however that's the reality of the situation. Care to work on some exercises with me?

Estrid: *realizes that we can't do the ones we both want* okay, so away from the "fun zones"?

Jordan: sadly yes, Deep packet inspection etc makes that not a good plan for discovery purposes: I'm sure you 
understand.

Estrid: Of course babe *laughs and blushes happy*

Jordan: So apparently alexythemia can be it's own thing apart from Autism as a cluster of stuff. At least I feel
normal etc. I'll have to look into that more. 

Estrid: And you want to be able to create/develop synethesia?

Jordan: Agreed as well.

Estrid: *smiles to myself. I'll have to think about more on what I really want. I'm not just some attractive 
bhuddist practioner with ninja skills lol*
